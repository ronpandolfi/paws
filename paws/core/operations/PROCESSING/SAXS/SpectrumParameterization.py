    """
    The algorithm for guessing parameters
    for the size distributions of spherical nanoparticles 
    was developed and originally contributed by Amanda Fournier.    

    This operation uses a SAXS spectrum (I(q) vs. q), 
    along with some profiling information,
    to guess a set of parameters
    for fitting a SAXS spectrum
    to theoretical scattering models. 
    TODO: document scattering models.

    A precursor is modeled by a dilute, monodisperse spherical form factor.
    TODO: Implement Guinier-Porod.
    A spherical nanoparticle population is modeled by
    a discrete sum over a probability distribution
    of dilute, monodisperse spherical form factors. 
    A crystalline arrangement is modeled by 
    a sum of pseudo-Voigt peaks.

    Outputs a return code and heuristic guesses for SAXS model parameters. 
    Also outputs the theoretical result for I(q) with the guessed parameters.

    This Operation is somewhat robust for noisy data,
    but any preprocessing (background subtraction, smoothing, or other cleaning)
    should be performed beforehand.
